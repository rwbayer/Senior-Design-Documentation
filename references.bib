Abstract = {The writers discuss voice output communication aids (VOCAs), which provide a recorded voice with the touch of a switch for nonverbal individuals. VOCAs are available in a wide range of options, from very complex, expensive systems to simpler, cheaper models. Research indicates that incorporating such technology as VOCAs into an infant's communication system of cooing, babbling, and gesturing complements rather than replaces other ways of communicating. Activities for nonverbal children that involve using VOCAs relate to teaching cause and effect, choice making, recording a call for action, getting a toddler involved with the VOCA, enhancing social relationships, and providing independence.},

@article{hetzroni,
Abstract = {This study investigated the use of a computer-based intervention for teaching orthographic symbols to children with autism. Through a structured seven-step fading procedure, children were taught to identify words from commercially available logos depicting food items. A multiple-probe design across participants was used to examine the effects of exposing 6 children with autism to 8 food items selected individually based on their meaningfulness to each child. The acquired knowledge was then tested for generalization into the classroom. Results indicated that after exposure to the fading procedure, all children were able to identify the orthographic symbols and maintain the knowledge over time. Most of the children were able to transfer the knowledge and generalize to daily activities within the classroom. Implications and future research directions are discussed.

@article{jeffries,
Abstract = {We tested the effectiveness of a tablet application and differential reinforcement to increase eye contact in 3 children with autism. The application required the child to look at a picture of a person's face and identify the number displayed in the person's eyes. Eye contact was assessed immediately after training, 1 hr after training, and in a playroom. The tablet application was not effective; however, differential reinforcement was effective for all participants. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {We investigated whether deficits in social gaze and affect and in joint attention behaviors are evident within the first year of life among siblings of children with autism who go on to be diagnosed with autism or ASD (ASD) and siblings who are non-diagnosed (NoASD-sib) compared to low-risk controls. The ASD group did not differ from the other two groups at 6 months of age in the frequency of gaze, smiles, and vocalizations directed toward the caregiver, nor in their sensitivity to her withdrawal from interaction. However, by 12 months, infants in the ASD group exhibited lower rates of joint attention and requesting behaviors. In contrast, NoASD-sibs did not differ from comparison infants on any variables of interest at 6 and 12 months. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {A study investigated whether the strategy of adding pictures to text improves reading skills, literacy skills, and silent reading comprehension among students with disabilities. Data were obtained from ten students aged between 6 and 12 at an elementary school in Colorado, all of whom had significant language delays and were considered nonreaders. Results revealed that students' performance in word identification, listening comprehension, and silent reading comprehension improved after exposure to reading materials to which pictures had been added. Results imply that picture-supported text offers an effective means of increasing reading skills in students with disabilities and of helping students meet content standards and perform as active learners in inclusive settings.},

Abstract = {The article examines the ways in which autistic students can learn in an inclusive art class. Topics discussed include the importance of the classroom environment for helping autistic students learn, the furniture that is in the classroom and the impact this can have on autistic students, and the role of lighting in the classroom. Ways in which educational media presentations can be made to accommodate students with autism are also explored. Specific information is provided regarding individuals on the nonverbal and nonauditory end of the autism spectrum. Necessary educational technology is also discussed.},
