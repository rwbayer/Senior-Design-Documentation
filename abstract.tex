\begin{abstract}
A good abstract is a concise summary (1--2 paragraphs) of the entire
project: introduction, problem statement, work accomplished, results,
conclusions, and recommendations. When you write the abstract, imagine
that the reader will not read anything else, but that you must get
your major point across immediately. This requires efficiency of words
and phrases. An abstract is written to stand alone, without jargon or
reference to figures and tables in the report body.
