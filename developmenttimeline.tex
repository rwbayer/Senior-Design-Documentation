\chapter{Development Timeline}
The development timeline shown below depicts the set of tasks that were completed throughout the year. We listed each task set by school quarter which roughly followed a requirements, design, implementation, then testing (RDIT) procedure. We formulated this timeline at the beginning of the Fall Quarter and stuck to it, with small modifications, in order to complete our project and documentation by the end of the Spring Quarter. Following a development timeline greatly helped us streamline our work, and make decisions to not spend too much time on a small part, but to focus on the bigger picture of the whole system.
