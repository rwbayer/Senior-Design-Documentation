\chapter{Lessons Learned}

Over the course of this project we climbed over many walls to develop a consistent and finished product. Here are the lessons we learned that helped us in this project and that we will carry on towards future work.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Be wary of dependencies.} The more outside tools that your project relies on, the more points of failure are induced. Be careful  of using too many tools that are outside of your control, and be prepared for them to suddenly change or not work.
	\item \textbf{Multiply estimated time by 5.} In most circumstances, whatever time you estimate a task to take, it will take longer. Planning for unexpected development time will provide for a more accurate time assessment. 
	\item \textbf{Seek feedback early and often.} To avoid unexpected changes of requirements and unnecessary implementations of features that the customer may not want, maintain continuous contact with the customer. The earlier along in the development stages you can get feedback, the easier it is to iterate on those changes.
	\item \textbf{Build it up piece by piece.} Incremental design will allow for easy feature integration and natural divisions for unit testing. Building piece by piece will improve code understanding and reduce the number of unexpected errors.
\end{enumerate}
