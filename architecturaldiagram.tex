Users will be able to use our application on their mobile tablet, acting as a client, in order to access our site. The server in our system will be responsible for storing data for each child in the database, formulating a categorization response of the verbal input, and delivering these results to the client. The database will be Google Datastore, and the Google App Engine server will write to and read from it order to access data.
