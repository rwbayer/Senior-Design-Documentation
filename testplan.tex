\chapter{Test Plan}

Our testing process can be broken into three main sections: an alpha release, two versions of a beta release, and unit testing. Unit testing will be done throughout the development process by the developers from Week 1 - 10 of Winter Quarter. Our alpha testing will take place between Weeks 3 and 7 of Winter Quarter. At this point, the system will be able to be used as a replacement for keyboard-to-speech generating devices and will have the ability to listen to conversations, but will not generate response suggestions. This will allow us to generate a baseline of both ends of a conversation. The feedback from this stage will help us refine our interface and move into the first beta, which will take place from Weeks 5-7 of Winter Quarter. This beta stage will be the first iteration of all features of the application. Feedback from this stage will be processed and incorporated into our last beta from March 27th to April 10th.
