\chapter{Testing Procedure}

Our testing process can be broken into three main sections: unit testing, an alpha release, and a beta release. Unit testing was done throughout the development process from Week 1 - 10 of Winter Quarter. Our alpha testing took place between Weeks 7 and 9 of Winter Quarter which was completed in participation with our industry expert at the Hope Technology School in Palo Alto, CA. At this point, the system was the first iteration of all the features of our application. The feedback from this stage helped us refine our interface and move into the beta, which took place from Weeks 1-5 of Spring Quarter.
